Hello! I'm Aayush Chalise, a passionate Linux developer and Rust expert with a deep love for open-source technologies. With over a year of experience in using Arch Linux, I have honed my skills in creating efficient and robust solutions tailored to Linux environments.

My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for the flexibility and power of Linux systems. Over time, this curiosity led me to explore various aspects of Linux development, from system administration to kernel customization. Along the way, I discovered Rust, a programming language that perfectly complements my passion for building secure and high-performance applications.

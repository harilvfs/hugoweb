# Brief

You can't mirror screen and sound together so we'll use two different tools to do the job. This method can be done on Linux & Windows but I am using Linux (Debian) in this case.

### Tools

[Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/Scrcpy) - for screen mirror

[sndcpy](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy) - for sound

# Install

Scrcpy:
```bash
sudo apt install scrcpy -y 
```
Sndcpy:
download the [latest release](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy#get-the-app) and extract the files

# Mirror

### Screen with Scrcpy
First, go to your device settings and enable developer mode then, connect your Android device to your computer with your charger.

Run Scrcpy on your computer terminal
```bash
Scrcpy
```
you should see your phone screen on another window like this

### Sound with Sndcpy

Run the linux file from the extracted files

```bash
./sndcpy
```
Now you can play anything to check everything.

# Recommendation

I use Scrcpy with some switches like:
```bash 
Scrcpy --turn-screen-off --stay-awake
```
You can see more on their Github page @ [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/Scrcpy#features)

& while using Sndcpy, just reduce the volume to 0% on the phone so you don't hear "echo" 

that's it ‚úåüèΩ

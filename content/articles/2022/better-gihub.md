Commandline for Github is complicated and complex however a tool called gh makes git so much easier on commandline and makes using Github that much quicker and easy. 

## Install 

Debian
```bash
sudo apt install gh
```

Windows
```powershell
winget install -e --id Github.cli
```

## Setup 
```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts but choose SSH as authentication method. You can use steps from [mansoorbarri.com/ssh-keys/](https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/create-github-ssh-keys/) to generate SSH keys for github.

## Set your repo to use GH auth

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mansoorbarri/website.git
```

*change "mansoorbarri/website.git" to your repo name**

## Bash Alias

You can add aliases when using linux to make it much more alias, I have added the following lines in my `~/.bashrc`

```bash
gcom() {
	git add .
	git commit -m "$1"
	}
lazyg() {
	git add .
	git commit -m "$1"
	git push
}
```

that's it ✌🏽

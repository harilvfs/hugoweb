## Brief

You can forward email with pretty much any domain provider but in this case I am using Cloudflare.

By the end of this article, you will be able to send and receive email from a custom email address that uses your domain name.

You will need to enable 2 Step verification on your google account for this to work.

## Step 1: Setup Cloudflare

The first step is to setup cloudflare so it can route email. In this case my domain is mansoor.cf and I will be routing test@mansoor.cf.

Open your cloudflare dash and go to the "Email" section from the sidebar

click "create address"

Under Custom address type the mail address you want, in this case I will be using test and click Save

## Step 2: Email Client Setup

## Gmail

Head over to the setting like so

Under "Accounts and Import" go to "Add another email address" in the "Send mail as"

Here enter the custom mail address as Email address

Here enter your details in this order

SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port: 587

Username: mansoorbarrii@gmail.com

Password: <<app password>>

Username should be your main gmail. In my case its mansoorbarrii@gmail.com

To get your app password go through these steps

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/). Go to App Passwords under Security.

From the 1st dropdown select "Mail" and "Other" from second

You can type anything in custom name. I am going with test@mansoor.cf

The yellow highlighted characters is your password

**You may encounter this error**

This happens becuase the page timed out. Try again with the same steps and it should work.

Verify your mail

## Email Certificates?

Yes, these are certificate which verifies that you are using a certain type of encryption (S/MIME) when sending mails. This is rare because it’s not really necessary plus it’s a pain to set it up correctly.

## Getting Email Certificate

{{< rawhtml >}} 
Go to <a href="https://extrassl.actalis.it/portal/uapub/freemail?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actalis's website</a>
{{< /rawhtml >}} 

Enter the email you want to verify, click on “send verification email” and enter the OTP from the email.

**Note: sometimes the email goes to the spam folder so make sure you check that as well*

Then check all the terms and condition and click on “Submit Request”.

On the next page it will show you a password, Save this password or better just print this page to a PDF file since this password will NOT be shown to you ever again and there is no way to get this page back.

Next download the .zip file they sent on your email and extract the certificate which is in .pfx file.

## Installing Certificates on your machine

**You don’t have to perform this step on Linux machines.*

Open the .pfx file and go through the prompts:

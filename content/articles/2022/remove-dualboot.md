ideally there should be 2 linux partition, one swap area and other is main disk partition. These are the two partitions I have

repeat the last two steps for the second partition. Once done right click on your main drive and click "Extend Volume" to add the free space to main partition

type
```
list disk
```
to list all the disks on your system

Select the disk where you installed your linux OS, in my case it's Disk 0 (zero)

```
select <DISK NUMBER>
```
Next, list the partitions by typing 
```
list part
```

Select the "System" partition by specifying it by partition number, in my case its partition 2

```
select part <PARTITION NUMBER>
```

then assign a drive letter to the partition. The drive letter should not be in use already, I will go with letter X

![Screenshot of the step](/img/guides/2022/remove-dualboot/2022_11.png)

Exit diskpart by typing
```
exit
```
You will be back in command prompt, here type 
```
<YOUR DRIVE LETTER>:
```

list the folders in the directory by typing 
```
dir
```

I am removing debian, so I will be typing 
```
rd debian /s
```
*change "debian" with your OS*

![Screenshot of the step](/img/guides/2022/remove-dualboot/2022_14.png)

Once done, you will have a new "Local Disk". It will be removed once you restart your PC.

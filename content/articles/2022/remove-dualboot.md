list disk

to list all the disks on your system

Select the disk where you installed your linux OS, in my case it's Disk 0 (zero)

```
select <DISK NUMBER>
```
Next, list the partitions by typing 
```
list part
```

Select the "System" partition by specifying it by partition number, in my case its partition 2

```
select part <PARTITION NUMBER>
```

then assign a drive letter to the partition. The drive letter should not be in use already, I will go with letter X

![Screenshot of the step](/img/guides/2022/remove-dualboot/2022_11.png)

Exit diskpart by typing
```
exit
```
You will be back in command prompt, here type 
```
<YOUR DRIVE LETTER>:

```
rd debian /s
```
*change "debian" with your OS*

Once done, you will have a new "Local Disk". It will be removed once you restart your PC.

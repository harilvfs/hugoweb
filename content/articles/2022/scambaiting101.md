## Getting started

Keep in mind that you are dealing with people who are criminals, giving your personal information is stupid to say the least. Making a fake persona here is helpful and what most people do.

A VPN isn't important since there is just enough they can do by finding your IP. A free vpn I suggest is [cloudflare's WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/) furthermore, there are many cheap VPNs which work great: Private Internet Access & OpenVPN are two of many. 

Additional, baiting a tech support scammer requires a bogus machine (usually windows). You can do this with softwares like [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) & [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). You can also do it without a counterfeit machine but it's not recommended and can be dangerous, **do it on your own risk.** 

## Calling

Using [Textnow](https://www.textnow.com/) is the best free option as of now, it allows you to have your own US numbers & provides free calls to US numbers (which most scammers use) moreover, you can use paid VOIP/SIP services.

Never ever use your own number or personal information as scammers will most likely use this against you by spoofing your number or addiing your number on a "list to scam call" making your life hell.

## Tracking/OSINT on Scammers

Some contact with the scammers can lead to their IP address. You can use [Glasswire firewall](https://www.glasswire.com/) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to trace their IP. 

Use a Remote Adminstration Tool (RAT) to surveillance a scammer's PC though it's illegal, you will not get caught until the scammer report it to the police which certainly doesn't happen. Using a RAT is a little bit advance so I would recommend not getting into this until and unless you know what you are doing & you don't mess around with it.

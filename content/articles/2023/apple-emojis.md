Since the [last guide](/guides/things-to-do-after-installing-deb/#emojis) on emojis on Linux, some mentioned how some emojis are still missing. I found another font pack on GitHub which works better. 

Github: https://github.com/samuelngs/apple-emoji-linux

## Download & Install
Just download the file from GitHub and either open it and click on install or move the .tiff file to `~/.local/share/fonts`

Either way, clear the cache by `fc-cache -f -v` and reopen your applications or restart your machine and it should work.


that's it <3

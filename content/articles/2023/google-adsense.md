## Context
Google adsense can be a great way to maintain a website as the earning aren't not much to sustain a household but can be enough to sustain a website and everything related to maintain a website (hosting, CMS etc)

### Google Adsense 
Google adsense can be a great way to start your journey however Google is quite picky with what is suitable for their adsense platform. 

I was rejected several times over a year with little to no information about what is wrong with my site; I was accepted finally after using multiple tools and tips from previous website owners like [TonyTeachesTech](https://www.youtube.com/@TonyTeachesTech). 

## Adsense Connect
Make sure you have: 
- connected your site successfully without any errors (Google Adsense will show any errors when you are connecting your site)
- Space for ads to display on your site 

## Tools 
- [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) - For SEO and errors like 404 & low word count pages 
- [webmatrices](https://webmatrices.com/adsense-eligibility-checker) - To check technical details which contribute to Google's approval 

### Ahrefs 
Ahrefs' setup is a bit lenghty and deserves a dedicated guide which will be posted soon. 

Ideally you should have 90% or over under Site Audit, I was at 98% when I started using Ahrefs; later I got it to be 100% whilst applying for Google Adsense. The trick is to have no "Errors" as they are the serious ones. At the time of this guide, I have 0 errors, 11 warnings and 3 notices.

### Webmatrices
Firstly, go to their website and enter your domain; for a high chance you would want at least 60% approval rate from Webmatrices. I was at 71.43% when I was accepted for Google Adsense. 

For `Pages Information` on Webmatrices, its not important for a individual creator to have "About Us" & "Contact Us" however privacy policy and terms and conditions are essential. 

## TLDR 
- You should be at least 18 at the time of applying adsense (Your photo ID will be asked)
- Have enough and good content 
- Your site should be "ad ready" 
- You should have enough site views & decent SEO 
- Illegal content is not allowed (Incl. ethical hacking)

that's it <3

### Create a new shortcode

To use the ```rawhtml``` shortcode, you'll first need to create a new shortcode file in your Hugo project. You can create a new shortcode file in the layouts/shortcodes/ directory. For example, you can create a file called rawhtml.html in the layouts/shortcodes/ directory.

In the ```rawhtml.html``` file, add the following line: 
```html
{{.Inner}}
```

### Usage
Now you can put your HTML within ```rawhtml``` shortcode for example the comments section for this post is present using a ```<script>``` tag. Code example:

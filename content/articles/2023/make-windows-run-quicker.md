Windows by default is quite bulky, sum this with a average hardware and now you have a useless blob of metal. You can make the performance better by tweaking several things as explained below. 

## CTT Wintool
[Chris Tituss']() tool is an essential tool to make significant changes to your Windows system. You can run the tool by: 

- Run Powershell as admin & run:
```powershell
irm christitus.com/win | iex
```
Few tweaks I recommend to make your system run smoother: 

### From the "tweeks" tab: 
- Disable Telemetry 
- Delete Temporary Files
- Remove Microsoft Edge

and then "run tweaks" 

### Go to "Updates" and select "Security (Recommended) Settings

## Usual Things
Basic steps include: 
- Uninstalling unsed applications
- Deleting unwanted files
- Emptying recycling bin 
- Deleting unwanted user accounts

## Advanced

However I have done this on many systems without any problems for years. 

### Disable Automatic Updates All together

You Can use something like Windows Update Blocker to completely disable updates unless you manual do so.

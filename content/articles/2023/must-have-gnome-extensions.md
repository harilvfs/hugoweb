# The list: 
- Clipboard History
- Tray Icons
- AlternateTab
- ArcMenu
- Emoji Selector

## [Clipboard History](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/)
Clipboard Indicator is the most important extension in my opinion, You should now see a clipboard history in the top bar once you install it.

## [Tray Icons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2890/tray-icons-reloaded/)
You can enable icons on your top bar

## [AlternateTab](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/15/alternatetab/)
Substitute Alt-Tab with a window based switcher that does not group by application.

## [Emoji Selector](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1162/emoji-selector/)
This extension provides a parametrable popup menu displaying most emojis, clicking on an emoji copies it to the clipboard.

If you need to manage the Group Policy settings in Windows 10 and 11, but find that the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) is not available in your edition of Windows, you can use an open-source application called PolicyPlus instead. Here are the steps to get Group Policy back in Windows 10 and 11 using PolicyPlus:

## Download 
PolicyPlus is available as a `.exe` file that you can download from the [PolicyPlus GitHub repository](https://github.com/Fleex255/PolicyPlus/releases). Once you download the ZIP file, extract it to a folder on your computer.

## Usage
Open the program & from the main screen, click "Open Local Group Policy" to access the Group Policy Editor.

Configure the Group Policy settings. Once you have accessed the Group Policy Editor in PolicyPlus, you can configure the same set of settings as you would in gpedit.msc. Simply navigate to the appropriate category and select the setting you want to modify. You can then modify the setting to your desired value and click "Apply" to save your changes.

## Backup
Before making any changes to the Group Policy settings, it's a good idea to save a backup of the current policy settings. To do this, click the "File" menu in the Group Policy Editor and select "Save As". Choose a location to save the backup file and give it a descriptive name.

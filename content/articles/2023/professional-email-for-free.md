## My Setup 
I shifted from cloudflare email routing to Zoho and it is working great as of now. 

I had my DNS on cloudflare and made one account with 2 aliases; I wasn't able to use Thunderbird on the free plan which is a bummer. I think a lot more people would go with Zoho if they allowed third party email clients. 

that's it <3

## Context
A ticketing system can be your first step in having your own helpdesk experience at home. This can be free and paid, in cloud or on prem which makes this a super nerdy/fun experience. 

We will be using Freshdesks' ticketing system as it provides quite good controls. 

## Setup 
- Go to https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/signup/ 
- Follow the signup process 

Note: "company email" can be your personal email as well.

### Ticketing Page setup 
When you login the first time, you will be asked to customise your Freshdesk like the link where your ticketing system will be hosted. For example, {name}.freshdesk.com. 

You can change this using pro version of Freshdesk or creating a redirect from your website like, ticket.mansoorbarri.com.

### Settings 
Some addional settings that you can change: 
- go to settings (cog icon on the left hand side) 
- "Agents" to add additional people who could reply the tickets 
- "Portals" customise the ticket i.e. adding your logo 
- "Ticket Fields" specify which fields are required and add fields you would want
- "Email Notifications" manage email messages whenever someone creates a ticket. 

There are many more settings that you can mess around with and set Freshdesk exactly where you want it to be. 

Note: when you signup, it does say that its on free trial however it will still work after the trial ends but without some features like workflows & ticket timing.

that's it <3

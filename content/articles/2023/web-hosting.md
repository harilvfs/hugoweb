so hosting is a bit weird especially for websites:
- some are over paying 
- some are scams 
- some are just perfect 

and it all comes down to your workflow and what do you wanna host. 

## Static sites 
Static sites are basically websites with just html, css & js. Nothing more, nothing less. You can host them in multiple ways but my prefered method is with Cloudflare Pages because of the following: 
- Cloudflare has the largest network for CDN 
- You can get a short URL as well like `abc.pages.dev` unlike GitHub's long URLs 
- It's quite easy to set-up & will help in your career as well 
- You can link it with GitHub for version control 

Cloudflare is pretty famous with enterprise customers especially those businesses who are just between "small" & "large business". I have all my websites hosted on Cloudflare and the speed and workflow is just too good. This website is also hosted on Cloudflare Pages 

### How to 
Its pretty much documented on YouTube and other blogs, my guide can be found here: https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/cloudflare-hugo

## Dynamic sites 
For this, I prefer going with Google cloud platform as its the fastest and pretty cheap as far as I know. You can also go with linode as they have a better support but if you know what you are doing, Google should be fine as well. 

I was admin for a website over at Plesk and its pain. The UI is slow and the website isn't that fast; it peaked at 10s which is disgusting. 

In the end its all about your needs. Most people have static sites so Cloudflare + Git makes perfect sense, hosting companies usually lure these people as well at awful rates which is just ugly. 

that's it <3

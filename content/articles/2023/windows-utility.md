Windows is clumsy and sluggish by default, but an application called [Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) developed by [Chris Titus](https://github.com/christitustech) can considerably improve it.

## Usage 
In PowerShell, run this command as administrator

```powershell
irm christitus.com/win | iex
```
Simply click on the items you want to change.

## Recommendation
- Select the appropriate option under "Tweaks," such as desktop or laptop. Personally, I prefer the "Minimal" option.
- Under "Updates", select "Security Settings" 

that's it <3

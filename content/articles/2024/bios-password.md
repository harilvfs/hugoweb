## Context

I was repairing a laptop with currupted Windows but got a blue screen with *"Enter Adminstration Password"* however, this password was never set and its not anywhere on the laptop which is confusing.

I saw some online ads of people offering to fix this for $100 which is just bs.

## Fixing BIOS Admin Password

First enter wrong password so it shows a *"System Disabled"* with a code. Something like this:

Now visit [bios-pw](https://bios-pw.org) and enter the code which is shown. Make sure you enter the alphabet as well. Something like this:

Now restart the laptop and the BIOS should be accessable.

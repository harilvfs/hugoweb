## Description
This error occurs when Git attempts to authenticate with a remote repository (such as GitHub) using HTTPS, but it fails to prompt you for your username. The root cause is often related to incorrect or missing Git credentials.

## Solution Steps
Follow these steps to fix the error:

1. **Check Your Git Configuration**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check your Git configuration:
     ```bash
     git config --global --list
     ```
   - Ensure that your `user.name` and `user.email` are correctly set. If not, update them using:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
     ```

2. **Update Git Credentials**:
   - Run the following command to update your Git credentials:
     ```bash
     git credential-manager-core configure
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to set up your credentials.

3. **Clear Cached Credentials**:
   - Sometimes cached credentials cause issues. Clear them using:
     ```bash
     git credential-cache exit
     ```

4. **Re-clone the Repository**:
   - If the issue persists, consider re-cloning the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
     ```

5. **HTTPS vs. SSH**:
   - Consider using SSH instead of HTTPS for authentication.

6. **Test Your Configuration**:
   - Run the following command to verify your Git configuration:
     ```bash
     git config --global --get-regexp credential
     ```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "fatal: could not read username for https://github.com: terminal prompts disabled" error. Happy coding! ðŸš€

Remember to replace `yourusername` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for further assistance.

I started using Markdown since I have been using Hugo (2020). It is pretty easy to pick up and nothing more to it however some tools make it easier to edit Markdown and some are just good to
have as a utility.

Here are four of these tools:

- [clipboard2markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/)
- [Markdown Editor](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/markdown)
- [codimd](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd)
- [md2pdf](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/)

## clipboard2markdown
Just a simple website which turns anything into Markdown. This is particularly useful when you have a normal formatted text (I.e., from Word) and you want it in Markdown.

## Markdown Editor
This tool is useful when you want to edit on a public computer. A saver for me as I do most of my work from college.

## codimd
I have actually never used this one however it can be useful if you collaborate with multiple people in a Markdown project.

## md2pdf
I have used this many times and it is quite useful when you want to send markdown files to someone. A simple markdown to pdf converter.

That's it, let me know if there are other Markdown tools you use.

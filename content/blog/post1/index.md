## ðŸš€ Installation

The installation script is designed for Arch-based systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script sets up default configurations and incorporates my custom settings. It is tailored for Arch-based systems and is currently compatible with SwayWM. If SwayWM is not installed, the script will bypass that section and proceed with the remaining configurations.

To setup, execute the following commands:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syy git
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run the binary file directly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/
chmod +x toolbox
./toolbox
```

### Updating
To update script, you will need to pull the latest changes from GitHub and restore the configs by running the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/linux-project
git pull
./setup.sh
```

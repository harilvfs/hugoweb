Ho Ho Ho,

I started this instead of blog since I wanted to have something a bit more personal and not just something which is there on the internet for literally everyone. This is "public" but its like this close community.

## College

Since my sister did her uni before me, she found assignments pretty hard especially with similarity and just stuff which is supposed to be similar like stats, titles, questions. & this was because she left everything for the last minute, thats why I am trying to do everything before anyone else in the class and it worked so YAY.

This letter is a bit short because I wrote a proper one and lost it. Next week it is gonna be a proper one. You can also find archives/old letters at [/newsletter](/newsletter) but a week later. 

that's it <3

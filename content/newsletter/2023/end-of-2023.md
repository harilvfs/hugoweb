This year has been a productive one to say the least. I manage to achieve many goals and did many things; even those which were unplanned. But lets start from last year.

## ðŸš€ Progress

This is how last year's goals went:

Post 3 times a week on mansoorbarri.com: I was able to post 3 times a week for majority of the year however because of G-Adsense, I had to remove around 10% of my posts because of their guidelines even though they didn't approve me yet. Some articles went on hepton.uk & some went on my profile over on Medium.com. Towards the end of this year, I stopped doing everything so there were no articles since November.
Commit and contribute more on GitHub: This is where I have been successful. I was able to commit to my own projects a lot more but more importantly, I contributed to others' code like GoKarna (My website's Hugo theme) & some of my friends'. I will try to continue this however it won't be my main focus.
Improve my network: If I'm being honest with myself, I didn't even try.

## âš” '24

- Create memories
- Focus on what's on hand rather than think about the future
- "Quality over quantity"

These are the goals for 2024, I want to be more to myself rather than just focus on work or other people && maybe get out of the cycle of doing too much work and taking a long break because of burn out. Because I used to believe that burn out wouldn't affect me but 2023 demonstrated how wrong I was.

With quality over quantity, I am thinking of starting a weekly journal series on Medium till December '24 & post on my website only when I have something technical to share.

## ðŸ§º Misc

I will be turning 18 officially this year so I am thinking of starting to invest in crypto & stocks, for which I have already started to learn and study how things work. Hopefully that goes well. ðŸ¤ž

Happy New Year to you doe <3

## Context
Decided to post blogs weekly probably which would be a bit informal and just about how things are going and my plans with mansoorbarri.com as the normal "blogging" wouldn't fit in articles, guides or write-ups. 

Mentioning the categories reminds me of how there are just two categories now `Guides` & `Blogs` making it easier for the end-user to just navigate through stuff. Since the change, I will be posting write-ups on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mansoorbarri) and the normal articles will be on the company website. 

## Company
This reminds me of the "company"; as of last year I wanted to make mansoorbarri.com a company which didn't make sense after a while so I registered [hepton.uk](https://hepton.uk) as a "pool" of freelancers which brings the overall cost of services lower and makes it easier for freelancers to work at hepton. 

Currently the "freelancers" are just friends & family since I know how they work and the quality of work. 

## Current Situation 
rn I am applying for Google Adsense to make mansoorbarri.com self-sufficient and focus on hepton.uk but it seems harder than I thought as I have been rejected 7 times since Jan 23. This is also why I have removed guides on hacking tools and write-ups as well as articles as they infringe with Google Adsense' policies. 

## Future 
I think I will be posting more on blogs as there is a lot going on but can't promise anything as things are changing a lot more and college will be starting on 5th too but we'll see.

that's it <3

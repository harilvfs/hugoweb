There is a block. An imaginary but physical block. Can’t write, can’t work on the website, can’t work on hobbies, can’t do anything. Hopelessness. The decision to write every week might be to optimistic but I have written 3 articles per week so one shouldn’t be a problem. I don’t know. Things not working makes me think of destructive things to do which isn’t good of course.

## The Website

this is what it looks like right now but the search doesn’t work still which is annoying. The developer is inactive and its been a week but still there is no reply. I have used this theme before, the search worked then && I tried importing my content on that website but still the search doesn’t work so I don’t know what the issue is. Its frustrating. But its more frustrating when you make a theme but decide not to be active for its support.

## Hepton

I have been posting content but there is no change in impressions so I guess we wait. I am thinking of writing articles for Hepton but I don’t think I can.

For this newsletter, I might just post tiny tiny newsletters just so I make something. Even now writing this reminds me of 10 other things I have to do so yuh. Like Ali Abdaal said,

> motivation is a myth. Trying to get yourself to feel like doing something useful is a fool’s errand. A 3-year old bases their day-to-day decisions on what they feel like doing. An intelligent student/adult recognises that feeling like doing something useful should have absolutely nothing to do with whether they actually do it.

yes, I logged in finally. I have been on a semi-formal break apparently but it wasn't like a break because i was just trying to learn new stuff and work at the same time. I got a bit off-college which means I have almost infinite time and summer didn't even start yet.

## üèÆ Learning 

I have been getting a feel of backend web development to complete my understanding of full-stack development. Do I want to do web development in the long-run? ~probably not but who knows. Few takeaways: 

React is just like Hugo but a lot more complicated.

Its like going from Python to C# 

I am starting to get why people use React (this is me 3 months in learning React) 

Right now (as of 25 June), I am stuck in [Tutorial Hell](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell) which isn't fun of course & I do want to start making stuff but but but I don't have any idea. I want to make something which is actually used by people and not another twitter clone. and before anything else, I want to change [Hepton](https://hepton.uk)'s website. 

I will give myself 1-2 months before I actually force myself to just create something otherwise, twitter clone it is. 


## ü•Ω Website and other stuff

My website has been going well, I surpassed 400 visitors in the last 28 days which is great and motivating too. Its also why i'm back to writing. But again, I do want to write how-tos but no idea. I might vomit all my React knowledge but I think, I should learn a bit more before I pass it on. (lol) 

I want to reach at least 1000 visits before '25 and probably explore more detailed blog posts and maybe a bit more insightful rather than just continue doing how-tos but that might be next year to be honest. Which remind me of- 

## üéØ 2024 Goals 

At the start of this year, I highlighted four things that I want to achieve in 2024. I thought of giving a progress update. 

- Create memories: I have but I have to force myself to do those things which isn't fun to say the least. I think doing just "tech" for so many years makes everything else pain. 

- Focus on what‚Äôs on hand rather than think about the future: This is something that was going quite well at the start of the year but the AI wave has just ruined this for me. & that is also one of the reason why I am focusing more on backend THAN frontend. Overall, yes I am worrying less about the future. 

- ‚ÄúQuality over quantity‚Äù: I think this is the major contributor to the 400 visitor mark on the website. I will keep posting quality work and lets see how it goes as we still have six more months to go. 

Hopefully that gave background to where I was and what I will be doing for the next 6 months. I will be posting you more consistently however, I think having a long period of break allows me to actually give a nuanced update rather than a half-arsed one. 


Thanks for reading this, hope you have a nice day.
